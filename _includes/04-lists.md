## Inspirations

#### Music

It seems that many people throughout the world find inspiration in music.
There is just something about a certain beat, rhythm, or lyrics that just connect with our brains
and a flurry of ideas, images, and scenarios flood our minds. I am no different.

I like a very wide range of music. Inspiration for me is all dependent of the mood and current energy state.
From heavy metal 🤘, to new-age ☁️, all the way over to synthwave 🌆.

Here is a list of my some of my most common go-to music inspirations:

- Carpenter Brut
- Zhu
- Metallica
- Gorillaz
- Enya
- GNR
- Ozy
