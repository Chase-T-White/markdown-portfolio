# Attributes

1. __Curious Mind__
  -- The most powerful tool in a game that is always evolving is the curiousity to find the cutting edge.

2. __Self Taught__
  -- Easily viewed as a weakness, **_though_** what makes a more impressive speciman: the *robot* that was built by man or the       *robot* that built itself.

3. **Languages**
  -- Everyone seems to be _enthralled_ by those with **multi-lingualed tongues**. How about **multi-lingualed brains**...
    Ok bad joke anyway here are the programming languages that kicked off my journey:
    
      1. Python
      2. HTML5
      3. CSS
      4. JS
